It's recommended to use an icon theme such as [Material Icon theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme) with this extension. 

NOTE: Slight modifications have been made to all syntax themes. Most modifications have been made to improve python support, especially for the Dark+ and OneDark Pro themes.
